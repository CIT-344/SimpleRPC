# SimpleRPC
A simple implementation of RPC using C# Sockets and JSON data serialization.


Completely written from scratch no outside libraries were used expect for JSON serialization. This library was written as a proof of concept to challenge myself. Please feel free to use this library for anything. It is functional with a lot of bugs and full of bad error handling.
